\begin{itemize}
    \item Symmetric networks:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item allows the use of \textbf{simple communication protocols}.
        \item provide \textbf{optimal fault-tolerance} for random failures, and
        \item \textbf{balance traffic} equally across link.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Moore networks provide:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{low latency}, and
        \item \textbf{low link load}, thereby supporting a \textbf{high number of workstations}.
    \end{itemize}     
    \item Modern DCN topologies have been designed according to the Moore bound. However, they are not symmetric.
    \item Some CGs have been used as model of PIN and DCN. However, most of them do not satisfy the Moore bound.
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}[t]{Conclusions (2/2)}
\begin{itemize}
    \item CGs provide a useful interconnection model for parallel computer systems that are symmetric and satisfy the Moore bound, e.g. Transposition graph.
    \item Some challenges:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Design methods for incremental expansion in the number of routers.
        \item Design methods for reduce the diameter by increasing the number of links between routers.
    \end{itemize}
